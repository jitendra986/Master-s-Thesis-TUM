The main file to compile is “main_thesis.tex”. In there, you also indicate the basic data (presentation purpose, title, conference, authors, etc.).

The contents of the thesis are written in separate chapters as separate TeX files in the folder “Chapters”.

The figures should be saved in the folder “Figures” as pdf or JPEG or PNG. EPS format is possible but will require a different compilation setting in your LaTeX editor.

The bibliography is in “references.bib”.

If you need to include new packages, write them in “preamble.tex”.

Do not modify “preambles_settings.tex”
